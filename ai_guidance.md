1. Look for "# vibe code instructions" comments at the start of files. Follow the instructions in the comment block below it. Always mention if you followed or ignored the instructions.
2. remember to bump the version of project/app/api.py in case APIs get changes
3. document the router itself and fields in api endpoints similar to project/app/v2/devices.py
4. remember to update CHANGELOG.md
5. check Release_DoD.md and remember me in chat if things are missing
